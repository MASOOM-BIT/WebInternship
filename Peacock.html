    <h3>How Givers, Takers, and Matchers Build Networks</h3>

    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Several decades ago, a man who started his life in poverty lived the
        American Dream. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in Missouri
        farm towns without indoor plumbing. To help support his family, the
        young man worked long hours on farms and paper routes. He put himself
        through college at the University of Missouri, graduated Phi Beta Kappa,
        and completed a master’s degree and then a doctorate in economics. He
        pursued a life of public service, enlisting in the Navy and then serving
        in several important roles in the U.S. government, earning the Navy
        Commendation Medal and National Defense Service Medal. From there, he
        built his own company, where he was chairman and CEO for fifteen years.
        By the time he stepped down, his company was worth $110 billion, with
        more than twenty thousand employees in forty countries around the world.
        For five consecutive years, Fortune named his company “America’s Most
        Innovative Company” and one of the twenty-five best places to work in
        the country. When asked about his success, he acknowledged the
        importance of “Respect . . . the golden rule . . . Absolute integrity .
        . . Everyone knows that I personally have a very strict code of personal
        conduct that I live by.” He set up a charitable family foundation,
        giving over $2.5 million to more than 250 organizations, and donated 1
        percent of his company’s annual profits to charity. His giving attracted
        the attention of former president George W. Bush, who commended him as a
        “good guy” and a “generous person.”
      </p>
      <p>
        His name was Kenneth Lay, and he is best remembered as a primary villain
        in the Enron scandal. Enron was an energy, commodities, and securities
        firm headquartered in Houston. In October 2001, Enron lost $1.2 billion
        in shareholder equity after reporting third-quarter losses of $618
        million, the biggest earnings restatement in U.S. history. In December,
        Enron went bankrupt, leaving twenty thousand employees jobless, many
        watching their life savings practically erased by the company’s fall.
        Investigators found that Enron had deceived investors by reporting false
        profits and hiding debts of more than $1 billion, manipulated energy and
        power markets in California and Texas, and won international contracts
        by giving illegal bribes to foreign governments. Lay was convicted on
        six counts of conspiracy and fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can debate about how much Lay truly knew about Enron’s illegal
        activities, but it’s difficult to deny that he was a taker. Although Lay
        may have looked like a giver to many observers, he was a faker: a taker
        in disguise. Lay felt entitled to use Enron’s resources for personal
        gain. As Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind describe in The Smartest Guys
        in the Room, Lay took exorbitant loans fromthe company and had his staff
        put his sandwiches on silver platters and fine china. A secretary once
        tried to reserve an Enron plane for an executive to do business, only to
        learn that the Lay family was currently using three Enron planes for
        personal travel. From 1997 to 1998, $4.5 million in Enron commissions
        went to a travel agency owned by Lay’s sister. According to accusations,
        he sold more than $70 million in stock just before Enron went bankrupt,
        taking the treasure from a sinking ship. This behavior was foreshadowed
        in the 1970s when Lay worked at Exxon. A boss wrote a reference
        recommending Lay highly, but warned that he was “Maybe too ambitious.”
        Observers now believe that as early as 1987, at Enron Oil, Lay approved
        and helped to conceal the activities of two traders who set up fake
        companies and stole $3.8 million while allowing Enron to avoid massive
        trading losses. When the losses were discovered, Enron Oil had to report
        an $85 million hit, and Lay denied knowledge and responsibility: “If
        anyone could say that I knew, let them stand up.” According to McLean
        and Elkind, one trader started to stand up but was physically restrained
        by two colleagues.

      <h3>Spotting the Taker in a Giver’s Clothes</h3>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever put your guard up when meeting a new colleague, it’s
        probably because you thought you picked up on the scent of self-serving
        motives. When we see a taker coming, we protect ourselves by closing the
        door to our networks, withholding our trust and help. To avoid getting
        shut out, many takers become good fakers, acting generously so that they
        can waltz into our networks disguised as givers or matchers. For the
        better part of two decades, this worked for Ken Lay, whose favors and
        charitable contributions enabled people to see him in a positive light,
        opening the door to new ties and sources of help. But it can be
        difficult for takers to keep up the façade in all of their interactions.
        Ken Lay was charming when mingling with powerful people in Washington,
        but many of his peers and subordinates saw through him. Looking back,
        one former Enron employee said, “If you wanted to get Lay to attend a
        meeting, you needed to invite someone important.” There’s a Dutch phrase
        that captures this duality beautifully: “kissing up, kicking down.”
        Although takers tend to be dominant and controlling with subordinates,
        they’re surprisingly submissive and deferential toward superiors. When
        takers deal with powerful people, they become convincing fakers. Takers
        want to be admired by influential superiors, so they go out of their way
        to charm and flatter. As a result, powerful people tend to form glowing
        first impressions of takers. A trio of German psychologists found that
        when strangers first encountered people, the ones they liked most were
        those “with a sense of entitlement and a tendency to manipulate and
        exploit others.”
      </p>
      <p>
        When kissing up, takers are often good fakers. In 1998, when Wall Street
        analysts visited Enron, Lay recruited seventy employees to pretend to be
        busy traders, hoping to wow the analysts with the image of a productive
        energy trading business. Lay led the analysts through the charade, where
        the employees were asked to bring personal photos to a different floor
        of the building so it looked like they worked there, and put on a show.
        They made imaginary phone calls, creating a ruse that they were busy
        buying and selling energy and gas. This is another sign that Lay was a
        taker: he was obsessed with making a good impression upward, but worried
        less about how he was seen by those below him. As Samuel Johnson
        purportedly wrote, “The true measure of a man is how he treats someone
        who can do him absolutely no good.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Takers may rise by kissing up, but they often fall by kicking down. When
        Lay sought to impress the Wall Street analysts, he did so by exploiting
        his own employees, asking them to compromise their integrity to
        construct a façade that would deceive the analysts. Research shows that
        as people gain power, they feel large and in charge: less constrained
        and freer to express their natural tendencies. As takers gain power,
        they pay less attention to how they’re perceived by those below and next
        to them; they feel entitled to pursue self-serving goals and claim as
        much value as they can. Over time, treating peers and subordinates
        poorly jeopardizes their relationships and reputations. After all, most
        people are matchers: their core values emphasize fairness, equality, and
        reciprocity. When takers violate these principles, matchers in their
        networks believe in an eye for an eye, so they want to see justice
        served.

      <h3>What Goes Around Comes Around</h3>
      <p>
        In 2011, Adam Rifkin had more LinkedIn connections to the 640 powerful
        people on Fortune’s lists than any human being on the planet. He beat
        out luminaries like Michael Dell, the billionaire founder of the Dell
        computer company, and Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn.* I was stunned
        that a shy, Star Trek–loving, anagram-obsessing software geek managed to
        build a network that includes the founders of Facebook, Netscape,
        Napster, Twitter, Flickr, and Half.com. Adam Rifkin built his network by
        operating as a bona fide giver. “My network developed little by little,
        in fact a little every day through small gestures and acts of kindness,
        over the course of many years,” Rifkin explains, “with a desire to make
        better the lives of the people I’m connected to.” Since 1994, Rifkin has
        served as a leader and watchdog in a wide range of online communities,
        working diligently to strengthen relationships and help people resolve
        online conflicts. As the cofounder of Renkoo, a start-up with Joyce
        Park, Rifkin created applications that were used more than 500 million
        times by more than 36 million people on Facebook and Myspace. Despite
        their popularity, Rifkin wasn’t satisfied. “If you’re going to get tens
        of millions of people using your software, you really should do
        something meaningful, something that changes the world,” he says.
        “Frankly, I would like to see more people helping other people.” He
        decided to shut down Renkoo and become a full-time giver, offering
        extensive guidance to start-ups and working to connect engineers and
        entrepreneurs with businesspeople in larger companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this end, in 2005, Rifkin and Joyce Park founded 106 Miles, a
        professional network with the social mission of educating
        entrepreneurial engineers through dialogue. This network has brought
        together more than five thousand entrepreneurs who meet twice every
        month to help one another learn and succeed. “I get roped into giving
        free advice to other entrepreneurs, which is usually worth less than
        they pay for it,” he muses, but “helping others is my favorite thing to
        do.” This approach has led to great things—not just for Rifkin, but also
        for those he’s shepherded along the way. In 2001, Rifkin was a big fan
        of Blogger, an early blog publishing service. Blogger had run out of
        funding, so Rifkin offered a contract to Blogger’s founder to do some
        work for his own first start-up, KnowNow. “We decided to hire him
        because we wanted to see Blogger survive,” Rifkin says. “We gave him a
        contract to build something for our company so we could use it as a demo
        and he could keep Blogger going.” The money from the contract helped the
        founder keep Blogger afloat, and he went on to cofound a company called
        Twitter. “There were several other people who also contracted with Evan
        Williams so he could keep his company going,” Rifkin reflects. “You
        never know where somebody’s going to end up. It’s not just about
        building your reputation; it really is about being there for other
        people.”

        After years of rearranging the letters in his name, Adam Rifkin has
        settled on the perfect anagram: I Find Karma.
