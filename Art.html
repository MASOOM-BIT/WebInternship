    <h3>Why Some Givers Burn Out but Others Are On Fire</h3>

    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Up to this point, we’ve been focusing on how givers climb to the top of the success ladder through the
unique ways that they build networks, collaborate, communicate, influence, and help others achieve
their potential. But as you saw in the opening chapter, givers are also more likely to end up at the
bottom of the success ladder. Success involves more than just capitalizing on the strengths of giving; it
also requires avoiding the pitfalls. If people give too much time, they end up making sacrifices for
their collaborators and network ties, at the expense of their own energy. If people give away too much
credit and engage in too much powerless communication, it’s all too easy for them to become
pushovers and doormats, failing to advance their own interests. The consequence: givers end up
exhausted and unproductive.
Since the strategies that catapult givers to the top are distinct from those that sink givers to the
bottom, it’s critical to understand what differentiates successful givers from failed givers. The next
three chapters examine why some givers burn out while others are on fire; how givers avoid being
exploited by takers; and what individuals, groups, and organizations can do to protect givers and
spread their success.
Recently, the Canadian psychologists Jeremy Frimer and Larry Walker led an ambitious effort to
figure out what motivates highly successful givers. The participants were winners of the Caring
Canadian Award, the country’s highest honor for giving, recognizing people who have devoted many
years of their lives to help their communities or advance a humanitarian cause. Many winners of this
award have sustained extraordinary giving efforts for decades in order to make a difference.

      <p>
        To reveal what drove them, all of the participants filled out a questionnaire asking them to list ten
goals in response to “I typically try to . . .” Then, Walker conducted in-depth interviews with twentyfive Caring Canadian winners and a comparison group of twenty-five people who matched the
winners in gender, age, ethnicity, and education, but had not sustained the same level or duration of
giving. Walker spent a hundred hours interviewing all fifty people about their lives, covering key
periods and critical events in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. From there, independent raters
read the goal lists, listened to the interview tapes, and rated the degree to which the participants
expressed two key motivations: self-interest and other-interest. Self-interest involved pursuing power
and achievement, whereas other-interest focused on being generous and helpful. On which set of
motivations did the Caring Canadian winners score higher than the comparison group?
The intuitive answer is other-interest, and it’s correct. In their life stories, the Caring Canadians
mentioned giving and helping more than three times as often as the comparison group. When they
listed their goals, the Caring Canadians listed nearly twice as many goals related to other-interest as
the comparison group. The Caring Canadians highlighted goals like “serve as a positive role model to
young people” and “advocate for women from a low-income bracket.” The comparison participants
were more likely to mention goals like “get my golf handicap to a single digit,” “be attractive to
others,” and “hunt the biggest deer and catch big fish.”

      <h3>Facing the Mirror: Looking Good or Doing Good?</h3>
      <p>
        But here’s the surprise: the Caring Canadians also scored higher on self-interest. In their life
stories, these highly successful givers mentioned a quest for power and achievement almost twice as
often as the comparison group. In their goals, the Caring Canadians had roughly 20 percent more
objectives related to gaining influence, earning recognition, and attaining individual excellence. The
successful givers weren’t just more other-oriented than their peers; they were also more selfinterested. Successful givers, it turns out, are just as ambitious as takers and matchers.
These results have fascinating implications for our understanding of why some givers succeed but
others fail. Up until this point, we’ve looked at reciprocity styles on a continuum from taking to
giving: is your primary concern for your own interests or others’ interests? Now I want to complicate
that understanding by looking at the interplay of self-interest and other-interest. Takers score high in
self-interest and low in other-interest: they aim to maximize their own success without much concern
for other people. By contrast, givers always score high on other-interest, but they vary in self-interest.
There are two types of givers, and they have dramatically different success rates.
Selfless givers are people with high other-interest and low self-interest. They give their time and
energy without regard for their own needs, and they pay a price for it. Selfless giving is a form of
pathological altruism, which is defined by researcher Barbara Oakley as “an unhealthy focus on
others to the detriment of one’s own needs,” such that in the process of trying to help others, givers
end up harming themselves. In one study, college students who scored high on selfless giving declined
in grades over the course of the semester. These selfless givers admitted “missing class and failing to
study because they were attending to friends’ problems.”
Most people assume that self-interest and other-interest are opposite ends of one continuum. Yet
in my studies of what drives people at work, I’ve consistently found that self-interest and otherinterest are completely independent motivations: you can have both of them at the same time. As Bill
Gates argued at the World Economic Forum, “there are two great forces of human nature: selfinterest, and caring for others,” and people are most successful when they are driven by a “hybrid
engine” of the two. If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish:
they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own
interests.
Selfless giving, in the absence of self-preservation instincts, easily becomes overwhelming.
Being otherish means being willing to give more than you receive, but still keeping your own interests
in sight, using them as a guide for choosing when, where, how, and to whom you give. Instead of
seeing self-interest and other-interest as competing, the Caring Canadians found ways to integrate
them, so that they could do well by doing good. As you’ll see, when concern for others is coupled
with a healthy dose of concern for the self, givers are less prone to burning out and getting burned—
and they’re better positioned to flourish.

      <h3>The Impact Vacuum: Givers Without a Cause</h3>
      <p>
        A decade ago, Howard Heevner, a dynamic director of a university call center, invited me to help himfigure out how to maintain the motivation of his callers. The callers were charged with contacting
university alumni and asking them to donate money. They were required to ask for donations three
times before hanging up, and still faced a rejection rate exceeding 90 percent. Even the most seasoned
and successful callers were burning out. As one experienced caller put it: “I found the calls I was
making to be extremely difficult. Many of the prospects cut me off in my first couple of sentences and
told me they were not interested in giving.”
I assumed that the takers were dropping like flies: they wouldn’t be as committed as the givers.
So during training, I measured whether each caller was a giver, matcher, or taker. In their first month
on the job, the takers were bringing in an average of more than thirty donations a week. Contrary to
my expectation, the givers were much less productive: they were struggling to maintain their
motivation, making fewer calls and bringing in under ten donations a week. I was mystified: why
were the callers who wanted to make a difference actually making the least difference?
I got my answer one day when I paid a visit to the call center, and noticed a sign one of the callers
had posted above his desk:

      </p>
      <p>
        After reading the letters, it took the givers just a week to catch up to the takers. The takers did
show some improvement, but the givers responded most powerfully, nearly tripling in weekly calls
and donations. Now, they had a stronger emotional grasp of their impact: if they brought in more
money, they could help more scholarship students like Will. By spending just five minutes reading
about how the job helped other people, the givers were motivated to achieve the same level of
productivity as the takers.
But the givers still weren’t seeing the full impact of their jobs. Instead of reading letters, what if
they actually met a scholarship recipient face-to-face? When callers interacted with one scholarship
recipient in person, they were even more energized. The average caller doubled in calls per hour and
minutes on the phone per week. By working harder, the callers reached more alumni, resulting in 144
percent more alumni donating each week. Even more strikingly, revenue quintupled: callers averaged
$412 before meeting the scholarship recipient and more than $2,000 afterward. One caller soared
from averages of five calls and $100 per shift to nineteen calls and $2,615 per shift. Several control
groups of callers, who didn’t meet a scholarship recipient, showed no changes in calls, phone time,
donations, or revenue. Overall, just five minutes interacting with one scholarship recipient motivated
twenty-three callers to raise an extra $38,451 for the university in a single week.* Although the
givers, takers, and matchers were all motivated by meeting the scholarship recipient, the gains in
effort and revenue were especially pronounced among the givers.
The turnaround highlights a remarkable principle of giver burnout: it has less to do with the
amount of giving and more with the amount of feedback about the impact of that giving. Researchers
have drawn the same conclusion in health care, where burnout is often described as compassion
fatigue, “the stress, strain, and weariness of caring for others.” Originally, experts believed that
compassion fatigue was caused by expressing too much compassion. But new research has challenged
this conclusion. As researchers Olga Klimecki and Tania Singer summarize, “More than all other
factors, including . . . the time spent caregiving, it is the perceived suffering that leads to depressive
symptoms in the caregiver.” Givers don’t burn out when they devote too much time and energy to
giving. They burn out when they’re working with people in need but are unable to help effectively.
Teachers are vulnerable to giver burnout because of the unique temporal experience that defines
education. Even though teachers interact with their students on a daily basis, it can take many years
for their impact to sink in. By then, students have moved on, and teachers are left wondering: did my
work actually matter? With no clear affirmation of the benefits of their giving, the effort becomes
more exhausting and harder to sustain. These challenges are pervasive in a setting like Overbrook,
where teachers must fight many distractions and disadvantages to stimulate the attention—let alone
attendance—of students. When Conrey Callahan was emotionally exhausted, it wasn’t because she
was giving too much. It was because she didn’t feel her giving was making a difference. “In teaching,
do I have an impact? It’s kind of dicey,” Conrey told me. “I often feel like I’m not doing anything
effective, that I’m wasting my time and I’m not making a difference.”
      </p>

        Ironically, because concern for their own interests sustains their energy, otherish givers actually
give more than selfless givers. This is what the late Herbert Simon, winner of the Nobel Prize in
economics, observed in the quote that opened this chapter. Otherish givers may appear less altruistic
than selfless givers, but their resilience against burnout enables them to contribute more.
