        In 1993, a man named Craig Newmark left IBM after seventeen years to
        take a computer security position at Charles Schwab in San Francisco. As
        a single guy new to the Bay Area, he was looking for ways to spice up
        his social life. In early 1995, he started e-mailing friends to share
        information about local arts and technology events. Word of mouth
        spread, and people began to expand the postings beyond events to feature
        job openings, apartments, and miscellaneous items for sale. By June, the
        e-mail list had grown to 240 people. It was too large for direct e-mail,
        so Craig moved it to a listserv. In 1996, a website was born, and it was
        called Craigslist. By the end of 2011, there were Craigslist sites in
        more than seven hundred locations around the world. In the United States
        alone, roughly fifty million people visit Craigslist each month, making
        Craigslist one of the ten most popular websites in the country—and one
        of the forty most visited in the world. Craigslist flourished by
        appealing to our basic matcher instincts. It facilitates transactions in
        which buyers and sellers can agree on a fair price, exchanging goods and
        services for what they’re worth. Fundamentally, Craigslist is about
        trading value in direct exchanges between people, creating a matcher’s
        preferred even balance of give and take. “We’re not altruistic,” Newmark
        writes. “From one perspective, we’re like a flea market.” Could a system
        like this function based entirely on giving, instead of matching? In
        2003, an Ohio native by the name of Deron Beal decided to find out. Just
        like Craig Newmark, Beal was in a new city where he lacked information,
        so he started an e-mail list of friends. Following the lead from
        Craigslist, Beal was aiming to create Internet-based local communities
        of exchange for
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea for Freecycle was sparked when Beal developed and ran a
        recycling program for businesses at a nonprofit organization called Rise
        in Tucson, Arizona. Local businesses began to give Beal used items that
        were still in good condition but weren’t recyclable, like computers and
        desks. In the hopes of giving the items away to people who needed them,
        Beal spent hours on the phone offering them to charities, but made
        little progress. At the same time, he had a bed that he wanted to give
        away, but thrift shops wouldn’t accept it. He realized that he might be
        able to solve both of these problems with an online community that
        matched givers and receivers more efficiently. Beal sent an initial
        e-mail announcing Freecycle to about forty friends, inviting them to
        join and spread the word. When some of the earliest Freecycle members
        started posting items to give away, Beal was caught off guard. One woman
        offered to give away a partially used bottle of hair dye, which would
        expire in a matter of hours. “It needs to be used really soon,” she
        wrote, “so if anyone has an urge to go darker, tonight is the night.” A
        Texas man posted a more desirable item—fishing tackle— but had a string
        attached. He would only give it away to someone from whom fishing tackle
        had been stolen. “As a kid thirty-four years ago, I stole a tackle box.
        There’s no way I can find the person and make it right, so I’m trying to
        do the next best thing.” With some people finding matcher loopholes in
        the system, and others trying to give away junk, Freecycle seemed like a
        lost cause. But Beal believed that “one person’s trash really is
        another’s treasure.” And some people gave away actual treasure on
        Freecycle that they could have easily sold on Craigslist. One person
        donated a camera in excellent condition worth at least $200; others gave
        away good computers, flat-screen TVs, baby car seats, pianos, vacuum
        cleaners, and exercise equipment. When Freecycle started in May 2003,
        there were thirty members. Within a year, Freecycle had grown at an
        astonishing rate: there were more than 100,000 members in 360 cities
        worldwide. By March 2005, Freecycle had increased tenfold in membership,
        reaching a million members

      <h3>The Altruism Debate</h3>
      <p>
        For nearly forty years, two of the world’s most distinguished
        psychologists have locked horns over whether the decision to give can be
        purely altruistic, or whether it’s always ultimately selfish. Rather
        than debate philosophy, each has come to battle wielding a deadlier
        weapon: the psychological experiment. The defendant of pure altruism is
        C. Daniel Batson, who believes that we engage in truly selfless giving
        when we feel empathy for another person in need. The greater the need,
        and the stronger our attachment to the person experiencing it, the more
        we empathize. When we empathize with a person, we focus our energy and
        attention on helping him or her—not because it will make us feel good
        but because we genuinely care. Batson believes that although some people
        feel empathy more intensely and frequently than others, virtually all
        humans have the capacity for empathy—even the most disagreeable of
        takers. As Adam Smith put it centuries ago: “the emotion which we feel
        for the misery of others . . . is by no means confined to the virtuous
        and humane, though they perhaps may feel it with the most exquisite
        sensibility. The greatest ruffian, the most hardened violator of the
        laws of society, is not altogether without it.” The devil’s advocate is
        Robert Cialdini, who argues that there’s no such thing as pure altruism.
        He believes that human beings are frequently generous, giving, and
        caring. But he doesn’t think these behaviors are entirely altruistic in
        origin. He believes that when others hurt, we hurt—and this motivates us
        to help. Cialdini’s first challenge to Batson’s claims was that when
        empathy leads us to help, it’s not because our ultimate goal is to
        benefit the other person. He proposed that when others are in need, we
        feel distressed, sad, or guilty. To reduce our own negative feelings, we
        help. Cialdini accumulated an impressive body of studies suggesting that
        when people feel distressed, guilty, or sad toward another person in
        need, they help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Batson’s rebuttal: it’s true that people sometimes help to reduce
        negative feelings, but this isn’t the only reason. And negative feelings
        don’t always lead to helping. When we feel distressed, sad, or guilty,
        our ultimate goal is to reduce these negative feelings. In some cases,
        helping is the strategy that we choose. But in many cases, we can reduce
        our negative feelings in other ways, such as distracting ourselves or
        escaping the situation altogether. Batson figured out a clever way to
        tease apart whether empathy drives us to help because we want to reduce
        another person’s distress or our own distress. If the goal is to reduce
        our own distress, we should choose whatever course of action makes us
        feel better. If the goal is to reduce another person’s distress, we
        should help even when it’s costly and other courses of action would make
        us feel good. In one experiment, Batson and colleagues gave people a
        choice: watch a woman receive electric shocks or leave the experiment to
        avoid the distress. Not surprisingly, 75 percent left. But when they
        felt empathy for the woman, only 14 percent left; the other 86 percent
        stayed and offered to take the shocks in her place. And of the people
        who stayed to help, the ones who empathized the most strongly were
        willing to endure four times as many shocks as those who felt less
        empathy. Batson and colleagues demonstrated this pattern in more than
        half a dozen experiments. Even when people can reduce their negative
        feelings by escaping the situation, if they’re feeling empathy, they
        stay and help anyway, at a personal cost of time and pain. On the basis
        of this evidence, Batson concluded that reducing bad feelings is not the
        only reason people help, and a comprehensive analysis of eighty-five
        different studies backed him up.

      <h3>From Enemies to Allies</h3>
      <p>
        During the 2008 global financial crisis, one of the many companies to
        suffer was a French firm that I’ll call Nouveau. Nouveau was
        headquartered in a small city in the middle of France that boasted a
        beloved soccer team. The founders had chosen the city as their
        headquarters in an effort to restore the city’s glory, but the
        population was shrinking and profits were falling, and there was
        pressure to relocate to a larger city. Nouveau’s executives decided to
        save headquarters with a dramatic reorganization. Seeking outside
        assistance, the CFO issued a request for proposals to consulting firms.
        Nouveau was open to working with whichever firm presented the best
        proposal, with one exception: one particular consulting firm could not
        be trusted. This firm had been working with Nouveau’s chief competitor
        for years. Nouveau’s top brass worried that inside information could be
        leaked accidentally—or even stolen by a taker. The suspect consulting
        firm’s lead partner, who I’ll call Phillippe, was aware of the distrust
        from the Nouveau executives. Phillippe’s firm had submitted proposals to
        Nouveau in the past, and they were always rejected. The consultants had
        repeatedly explained the firm’s strict confidentiality policies, but the
        Nouveau executives didn’t buy it. Eventually, the consultants concluded
        that it was a waste of time to continue making proposals. But Phillippe
        was genuinely interested in contributing to Nouveau’s success, so he led
        his team in preparing and submitting a proposal for the reorganization.
        Then they sat down to brainstorm: how can we prove to Nouveau that we’re
        trustworthy?
      </p>
      <p>
        Phillippe’s firm was the last to pitch to Nouveau. At the pitch meeting,
        Phillippe arrived at Nouveau’s headquarters with five consultants in
        tow. They were escorted into a large room where ten Nouveau executives
        sat across from them. Phillippe’s team presented the proposal, and the
        Nouveau executives were unmoved. “We like your proposal,” one executive
        said, “but we can’t trust you. Why should we enter into a relationship
        with you? How can we be sure that you will put our interests first?”
        Phillippe reminded them of his firm’s confidentiality policies and code
        of honor, reinforcing that its reputation hinged on upholding the
        highest standards for clients, but his promise fell on deaf ears.
        Phillippe had run out of logical arguments, so he resorted to the only
        other ammunition that he had. He reached into his briefcase and pulled
        out the blue scarf of the city’s famed soccer club. Donning the scarf as
        a symbol of hometown pride, he made a plea: “We’ve been trying to
        convince you for many years that our confidentiality policies can be
        trusted. Since we’re not managing to say that with words, we’d like to
        show our commitment in a different way.” The five members of Phillippe’s
        team followed suit, putting the soccer scarves around their necks. The
        Nouveau executives were surprised. They asked which partner would take
        the lead on the project. Phillippe stepped up: “I am going to take the
        lead, and we will begin our work over the August break. I can commit to
        this because your headquarters is next to my home.” A few hours later,
        Phillippe’s firm landed the project. The Nouveau executives had not
        known that Phillippe was from their city. “This was a reorganization
        task,” Phillippe explains, “and having someone care about this city, and
        the people living in it, was a plus for the employees and the company.
        It was a bit of common ground.”
      </p>

        At the end of the semester, the cynical student who had questioned
        whether there were any givers at Wharton quietly approached me.
        “Somehow,” he said, “everyone in the class became intrinsically
        motivated to give, and it transcends the class itself.”
