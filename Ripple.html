        You probably don’t recognize George Meyer’s name, but you’re definitely
        familiar with his work. In fact, odds are that someone close to you is a
        big fan of his ideas, which have captivated an entire generation of
        people around the world. Although I didn’t know it belonged to him until
        recently, I’ve admired his work since I was nine years old. Meyer is a
        tall, angular man in his mid-fifties who sports long, stringy hair and a
        goatee. If you ran into him on the street, you wouldn’t be able to place
        his face, but you might have a hunch that he’s a Grateful Dead fan.
        You’d be right: in the last five years of Jerry Garcia’s life, Meyer
        attended at least seventy different Grateful Dead concerts. Meyer
        attended college at Harvard, where he was nearly suspended after he sold
        a refrigerator to a freshman and accepted payment, but never delivered
        it. He was almost suspended again when he used an electric guitar to
        shatter a window of a dorm room. A rare bright spot in his college
        career was being elected president of the Harvard Lampoon, the famous
        comedy magazine, but it was quickly tarnished by an attempted coup.
        According to journalist David Owen, Meyer’s peers “tried to overthrow
        him in a bitter and vituperative internal battle, because they thought
        he wasn’t responsible enough.”
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating from college in 1978, Meyer moved back home and looked
        for ways to earn quick cash. He spent much of his time in college
        gambling on dog races at a greyhound track, so he thought he might be
        able to make a career out of it. He parked himself at a public library
        and began analyzing scientific strategies for beating the system. It
        didn’t work: after two weeks, he ran out of money. Three decades later,
        George Meyer is one of the most successful people in show business. He
        has been a major contributor to a movie that grossed more than $527
        million. He has won seven Emmy Awards and invented several words that
        have entered English dictionaries—one of which was uttered every day by
        my college roommate for four years. But he is most celebrated for his
        role in a television phenomenon that has changed the world. Insiders
        maintain that as much as any other person, he is responsible for the
        success of the show that Time magazine named the single best television
        series of the twentieth century
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1981, at the recommendation of two friends, Meyer sent a few writing
        samples to a new NBC show called Late Night with David Letterman.
        “Everything in his submission, down to the last little detail, was so
        beautifully honed,” Letterman gushed to Owen. “I haven’t run across
        anybody quite like that since.” During the first season, Meyer invented
        what was to become one of Letterman’s signature routines: using a steam
        roller to crush ordinary objects, like pieces of fruit. After two years
        with Letterman, Meyer left to work on The New Show with Lorne Michaels
        and then joined Saturday Night Live, departing in 1987 to write a script
        for a Letterman movie that was ultimately shelved. When Meyer’s two
        friends recommended him to Letterman, they called him “the funniest man
        in America.” This wasn’t a statement to be taken lightly—the two went on
        to become an Emmy-winning pair of comedy writers on shows like Seinfeld,
        The Wonder Years, and Monk. And if you look at what George Meyer has
        accomplished since he finished the Letterman movie script, you might be
        inclined to agree with them. George Meyer is the mastermind of much of
        the humor on The Simpsons, the longest-running sitcom and animated
        program in America. The Simpsons has won twenty-seven prime-time Emmy
        Awards, six of which went to Meyer, and changed the face of animated
        comedy. Although Meyer didn’t launch The Simpsons—it was created by Matt
        Groening and developed with James L. Brooks and Sam Simon—there is
        widespread consensus that Meyer was the most important force behind the
        show’s success. Meyer was hired to write for The Simpsons before it
        premiered in 1989, and he was a major contributor for sixteen seasons as
        a writer and executive producer. Meyer “has so thoroughly shaped the
        program that by now the comedic sensibility of The Simpsons could be
        viewed as mostly his,” writes Owen. According to humor writer Mike
        Sacks, “Meyer is largely considered among the writing staff to be its
        behind-the-scenes genius among geniuses,” the man “responsible for the
        best lines and jokes.” Jon Vitti, one of the original Simpsons writers
        who authored many of the early episodes and later served as a producer
        on The Of ice, elaborated that Meyer is “the one in the room who writes
        more of the show than anyone else—his fingerprints are on nearly every
        script. He exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without
        being one of the creators.” How does a man like George Meyer become so
        successful in collaborative work? Reciprocity styles offer a powerful
        lens for explaining why some people flourish in teams while others fail.
        In Multipliers, former Oracle executive Liz Wiseman distinguishes
        between geniuses and genius makers. Geniuses tend to be takers: to
        promote their own interests, they “drain intelligence, energy, and
        capability” from others. Genius makers tend to be givers: they use their
        “intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities” of other people,
        Wiseman writes, such that “lightbulbs go off over people’s heads, ideas
        flow, and problems get solved.” My goal in this chapter is to explore
        how these differences between givers and takers affect individual and
        group success.

      <h3>Flying Solo</h3>
      <p>
        In the twentieth century, perhaps no person was more emblematic of
        eminent creativity than Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1991, Wright was
        recognized as the greatest American architect of all time by the
        American Institute of Architects. He had an extraordinarily productive
        career, designing the famous Fallingwater house near Pittsburgh, the
        Guggenheim Museum, and more than a thousand other structures—roughly
        half of which were built. In a career that spanned seven decades, he
        completed an average of more than 140 designs and 70 structures per
        decade. Although Wright was prolific throughout the first quarter of the
        twentieth century, beginning in 1924, he took a nine-year nosedive. As
        of 1925, “Wright’s career had dwindled to a few houses in Los Angeles,”
        write sociologist Roger Friedland and architect Harold Zellman. After
        studying Wright’s career, the psychologist Ed de St. Aubin concluded
        that the lowest Wright “ever sank architecturally occurred in the years
        between 1924 and 1933 when he completed only two projects.” Over those
        nine years, Wright was about thirty-five times less productive than
        usual. During one twoyear period, he didn’t earn a single commission,
        and he was “floundering professionally,” notes architecture critic
        Christopher Hawthorne. By 1932, “the world-famous Frank Lloyd Wright”
        was “all but unemployed,” wrote biographer Brendan Gill. “His last major
        executed commission had been a house for his cousin” in 1929, and “he
        was continuously in debt,” to the point of struggling “to find the
        wherewithal to buy groceries.” What caused America’s greatest architect
        to languish? Wright was one of the architects invited to participate in
        MacKinnon’s study of creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although he declined the invitation, the portrait of the creative
        architect that emerged from MacKinnon’s analysis was the spitting image
        of Wright. In his designs, Frank Lloyd Wright appeared to be a
        humanitarian. He introduced the concept of organic architecture,
        striving to foster harmony between people and the environments in which
        they lived. But in his interactions with other people, he operated like
        a taker. Experts believe that as an apprentice, Wright designed at least
        nine bootleg houses, violating the terms of his contract that prohibited
        independent work. To hide the illegal work, Wright reportedly persuaded
        one of his fellow draftsmen to sign off on several of the houses. At one
        point, Wright promised his son John a salary for working as an assistant
        on several projects. When John asked him to be paid, Wright sent him a
        bill itemizing the total amount of money that John had cost over the
        course of his life, from birth to the present. When designing the famous
        Fallingwater house, Wright stalled for months. When the client, Edgar
        Kaufmann, finally called Wright to announce that he was driving 140
        miles to see his progress, Wright claimed the house was finished. But
        when Kaufmann arrived, Wright had not even completed a drawing, let
        alone the house. In the span of a few hours, before Kaufmann’s eyes,
        Wright sketched out a detailed design. Kaufmann had commissioned a
        weekend cottage at one of his family’s favorite picnic spots, where they
        could see a waterfall. Wright had a radically different idea in mind: he
        drew the house on a rock on top of the waterfall, which would be out of
        sight from the house. He convinced Kaufmann to accept it, and eventually
        charged him $125,000 for it, more than triple the $35,000 specified in
        the contract. It’s unlikely that a giver would have ever been
        comfortable deviating so far from a client’s expectations, let alone
        convincing him to endorse it enthusiastically and charging extra for it.
        It was a taker’s mind-set, it seems, that gave Wright the gall to
        develop a truly original vision and sell it to a client.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the very same taker tendencies that served Wright well in
        Fallingwater also precipitated his nine-year slump. For two decades,
        until 1911, Wright made his name as an architect living in Chicago and
        Oak Park, Illinois, where he benefited from the assistance of
        craftspeople and sculptors. In 1911, he designed Taliesin, an estate in
        a remote Wisconsin valley. Believing he could excel alone, he moved out
        there. But as time passed, Wright spun his wheels during “long years of
        enforced idleness,” Gill wrote. At Taliesin, Wright lacked access to
        talented apprentices. “The isolation he chose by creating Taliesin,” de
        St. Aubin observes, “left him without the elements that had become
        essential to his life: architectural commissions and skillful workers to
        help him complete his building designs.”

      <h3>I Wish I Could Hate You</h3>
      <p>
        After Meyer left Saturday Night Live in 1987, he hightailed it out of
        New York City and moved to Boulder, Colorado, to work on the Letterman
        movie script alone. Just like Frank Lloyd Wright, Meyer had isolated
        himself from his collaborators. But in stark contrast to Wright, Meyer
        recognized that he needed other people to succeed. He knew his
        performance was interdependent, not independent: his ability to make
        people laugh was due in part to collaborating with fellow comedy
        writers. So he reached out to people who had worked with him at the
        Lampoon and on his past shows, inviting them to contribute to Army Man.
        “I believe that collaboration is such a beautiful thing, especially in
        comedy,” Meyer told me. “In a community of funny people, you can get
        that rare synergy, jokes you never could have come up with on your own.”
        Four colleagues ended up helping Meyer with the inaugural issue. One of
        those colleagues was Jack Handey, who contributed an early installment
        of “Deep Thoughts,” which went on to become a wildly popular series of
        jokes. Meyer published “Deep Thoughts” three years before they became
        famous on Saturday Night Live, and they contributed to the success of
        Army Man. The juxtaposition of George Meyer with Frank Lloyd Wright
        reveals how givers and takers think differently about success. Wright
        thought he could take his architectural genius from Chicago, where he
        worked with a team of experts, to a remote part of Wisconsin, where he
        was largely alone. Wright’s family motto was “truth against the world,”
        and it’s a familiar theme in Western culture. We tend to privilege the
        lone genius who generates ideas that enthrall us, or change our world.
        According to research by a trio of Stanford psychologists, Americans see
        independence as a symbol of strength, viewing interdependence as a sign
        of weakness. This is particularly true of takers, who tend to see
        themselves as superior to and separate from others. If they depend too
        much on others, takers believe, they’ll be vulnerable to being outdone.
        Like Wright, the star analysts who left their investment banks without
        their successful teams—or without considering the quality of the new
        teams they were joining —fell into this trap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Givers reject the notion that interdependence is weak. Givers are more
        likely to see interdependence as a source of strength, a way to harness
        the skills of multiple people for a greater good. This appreciation of
        interdependence heavily influenced the way that Meyer collaborated. He
        recognized that if he could contribute effectively to the group,
        everyone would be better off, so he went out of his way to support his
        colleagues. When Meyer wrote for Saturday Night Live in the mid1980s as
        a virtual unknown, he was almost always in the office, making himself
        available to give feedback. He ended up helping famous comedians like
        Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman, and Randy Quaid with their writing and
        delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time Meyer released the second issue of Army Man, he had thirty
        contributors. They all wrote jokes for free, and their careers soared
        along with Meyer’s. At least seven of those contributors went on to
        write for The Simpsons. One contributor, Spike Feresten, wrote a single
        Simpsons episode in 1995, and became an Emmy-nominated writer and
        producer on Seinfeld, where he wrote the famous “Soup Nazi” episode. And
        the Army Man contributors who didn’t become Simpsons writers achieved
        success elsewhere. For example, Bob Odenkirk is a well-known writer and
        actor, Roz Chast is a staff cartoonist for The New Yorker, and Andy
        Borowitz became a bestselling author and creator of “The Borowitz
        Report,” a satire column and website with millions of fans. Before that,
        Borowitz coproduced the hit movie Pleasantville and created The Fresh
        Prince of Bel-Air, which in turn launched Will Smith’s career. By
        inviting them to write for Army Man, Meyer helped them soar. “I just
        asked the people who made me laugh to contribute,” Meyer told Mike
        Sacks. “I didn’t realize they would become illustrious.”
