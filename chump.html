        Lillian Bauer was a brilliant, hardworking manager at an elite
        consulting firm. She was recruited out of Harvard, and after leaving the
        firm to complete her MBA, her consulting firm lured her back. She was
        widely seen as a rising star, and she was on track to make partner far
        ahead of schedule, until word began to spread that she was too generous.
        Her promotion to partner was delayed for six months, and she received
        very direct feedback that she needed to say no more often to clients and
        colleagues. After a full year, she still had not made it. Bauer was
        passionate about making a difference. She devoted several years to a
        nonprofit organization helping women launch and grow businesses. There,
        she introduced a microloan program, opening doors for low-income women
        to start their own companies. In one case, a woman needed a loan to open
        a salon, but was turned down by two banks. Bauer worked with her to
        strengthen her business plan and financial statements, and both banks
        ended up offering her loans at highly competitive rates. As a
        consultant, Bauer spent countless hours mentoring new employees, giving
        career advice to associates, and even helping junior colleagues
        strengthen their applications to business school. “I really want to
        help. If an hour of my time saves people ten hours or gives them an
        opportunity they otherwise wouldn’t have, it’s easy to make the tradeoff
        and give another hour of my time.” Bauer was extremely talented and
        driven, but she took giving so far that it was compromising her
        reputation and her productivity. “She never said no to anything,”
        explained one consulting colleague. “She was so generous and giving with
        her time that she fell into the trap of being more of a pushover. It
        really delayed her promotion to partner.” In a performance review, Bauer
        was told that she needed
      </p>
      <p>
        In a study that mirrors Bauer’s experience, management professors Diane
        Bergeron, Abbie Shipp, Ben Rosen, and Stacie Furst studied more than
        3,600 consultants in a large professional services firm. The researchers
        coded giving behavior from company records of the weekly time that each
        consultant spent helping new hires, mentoring more junior consultants,
        and sharing knowledge or expertise with peers. After a year of tracking
        these giving behaviors every week, the researchers obtained data on each
        consultant’s salary, advancement speed, and promotions. The givers did
        worse on all three metrics. They had significantly lower salary
        increases, slower advancement, and lower promotion rates. The givers
        averaged 9 percent salary increases, compared with 10.5 percent and 11.5
        percent for the takers and matchers, respectively. Less than 65 percent
        of the givers were promoted to a manager role, compared with 83 percent
        and 82 percent for the takers and matchers, respectively. And the givers
        who did get promoted had to wait longer, averaging twenty-six months to
        promotion, compared with less than twenty-four months for takers and
        matchers. This was a familiar pattern to Bauer: “If I err on one side,
        it’s probably being too generous: putting others first, before myself.”
        Hundreds of miles east at Deloitte Consulting in New York City, Jason
        Geller was also on the fast track to partner. When he first started in
        consulting, Deloitte was just moving to e-mail and did not have a
        formalized knowledge management process—there was no system for storing
        and retrieving information that consultants gathered on specific
        industries and clients. Geller took the initiative to collect and share
        information. When he heard about a project, he would ask the team for
        its output. He kept a stack of articles on his nightstand, reading them
        in bed, and when he came across an interesting article, he would file it
        away. He conducted research on what Deloitte’s competitors were doing.
        “I was a little bit of a geek.” Deloitte’s knowledge management system
        became Jason Geller’s brain, and his hard drive. His colleagues began
        calling it the J-Net, the Jason Network. When they had questions or
        needed information, he was the go-to guy. It was easier to ask him than
        to search for themselves, and he was always willing to share the
        knowledge from his brain or his growing database. No one asked him to
        create the J-Net; he just did it because it seemed like the right thing
        to do. Since graduating from Cornell, Geller had spent his entire career
        at Deloitte, doing an MBA at Columbia along the way. He was grateful for
        the support that his mentors provided to him. A matcher would have paid
        it back, looking for ways to return the favor to his mentors. But as a
        giver, like Lillian Bauer, Geller wanted to pay it forward. “It becomes
        the natural way of doing things. You see that the folks who are
        successful are the ones who help others. I naturally fell into the
        practice of helping others. I saw that others created those
        opportunities for me, and I now work very hard to create them for other
        people.” Geller made a standing offer to every new employee: he would
        help and mentor them in any way that he could

      <h3>Sincerity Screening: Trusting Most of the People Most of the Time</h3>
      <p>
        In the opening chapter, we met an Australian financial adviser named
        Peter Audet, whose giver style paid off when he took a drive to visit a
        scrap metal client. But long before that, before he figured out how to
        be more otherish than selfless, Peter was ripped off by several takers.
        At twenty-two, he started his career as a financial adviser at a
        cutthroat company. It was his responsibility to aggressively build an
        insurance division for a business that primarily served retirement
        clients. Peter was working weekends to generate six-figure annual
        revenues, but received a tiny fraction of the revenues, taking home
        minimum wage of $400 per week. He stayed for nearly three years, and it
        was the most miserable time of his life. “My boss was greedy. He never
        recognized what you did, only what he could get from you.” In
        appreciation of Peter’s services, one of his insurance clients sent him
        a beautiful Christmas basket. His boss, a wealthy man who drove to work
        in a Mercedes-Benz, saw the basket and immediately took it home for
        himself: “I’m the boss, and it’s mine.” Peter felt like he was drowning,
        and decided to strike off on his own as a financial adviser. In his
        first year alone, he quadrupled his salary. But five years later, he was
        manipulated by another taker. A friendly colleague, Brad, was not doing
        well at work. Brad landed another position that would start the
        following week, and he asked Peter for a favor. Would he buy Brad’s
        clients on two days’ notice so that Brad could afford to leave? As a
        giver, Peter trusted Brad and agreed on the spot. He purchased Brad’s
        clients and began forging relationships with them, helping to solve
        their financial problems. After a few months, Peter started to lose some
        of his clients. Strangely, they were all former clients of Brad’s. It
        turned out that Brad was back in the business as a financial adviser,
        and he had called every one of the clients who he had sold to Peter. He
        just wanted to let them know he was back, and they were welcome to
        switch over to work with him again. Brad stole many of the clients back
        without paying Peter a dime for them. Peter lost around $10,000 in
        business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had Peter been able to identify Brad from the start as a taker, he might
        never have gone down that road. Trust is one reason that givers are so
        susceptible to the doormat effect: they tend to see the best in
        everyone, so they operate on the mistaken assumption that everyone is
        trustworthy. In one study, researchers tracked whether Americans had
        been victims of crimes such as fraud, con games, and identity theft. The
        givers were twice as likely to be victimized as the takers, often as a
        direct result of trusting takers. One giver was generous enough to
        cosign for a friend’s car loan, and over a five-year period, the friend
        opened three credit cards in his identity, stealing more than $2,000. To
        avoid getting scammed or exploited, it’s critical to distinguish the
        genuine givers from the takers and fakers. Successful givers need to
        know who’s likely to manipulate them so that they can protect
        themselves. Do we actually know takers when we see them? Many people
        think they can judge givers and takers in the blink of an eye. But in
        reality, they’re wildly inaccurate. Blink again. I don’t mean to imply
        that we fail across the board in thin slicing. As Malcolm Gladwell
        revealed in Blink, many of our snap judgments of people are strikingly
        accurate. At a glance, we can often spot a passionate teacher, an
        extraverted salesperson, or a married couple in contempt. But we
        struggle mightily when guessing who’s a genuine giver. In one study,
        economists asked a group of Harvard students to predict the giving and
        taking behaviors of their close friends and of complete strangers. The
        friends and strangers received fifty tokens worth between ten and thirty
        cents each, and were asked to divide the tokens between themselves and
        the Harvard students. The Harvard students did no better in predicting
        how much their friends would give than they did in predicting the
        behavior of complete strangers. “They correctly expect that friends pass
        more tokens than strangers,” the researchers write, “but they do not
        expect more tokens from generous friends compared to selfish friends.”
        This is a crucial mistake, because the giving friends end up
        contributing quite a bit more than the takers.

      <h3>Generous Tit for Tat: The Adaptable Giver</h3>
      <p>
        ASeveral years after Brad stole his clients and his money, Peter Audet
        was working with a business partner named Rich. When they first paired
        up, Rich came across as highly agreeable: he was enthusiastic and
        friendly. But a colleague reflects that “although Rich looked like a
        giver because he acted supportive, he was really a taker. Peter was a
        giver, and Rich was sucking everything out of him.” Rich was drawing a
        high salary, more than $300,000 a year, without contributing much to the
        financial success of the business. He was living on the Gold Coast of
        Australia, and he would spend his mornings on the beach, stroll into the
        office at ten A.M., and go to the pub at midday. “Brad gave me a pretty
        strong sense of what a taker looked like, and I realized that Rich was a
        big taker,” Peter laments. “I was always doing extra work, and Rich was
        absolutely draining the business of money. He didn’t really care about
        the staff or service to clients; he was starting to pollute the culture.
        He was taking advantage of me, trading off the back of my loyalty to him
        because we had built the business up from nothing.” Peter stayed timid
        until one Monday, when Rich announced that he had bought a
        multimilliondollar house on the Gold Coast. He needed $100,000, and he
        took it right out of the company account. At a board meeting that day,
        Rich left early to meet friends at the pub. This was the last straw for
        Peter; he knew Rich could no longer be trusted, so he promised the board
        that he would hold Rich accountable. But he had yet to formulate a
        plan—and he felt guilty and uncomfortable: “Rich was like my big
        brother.” A colleague said, “It would have been hard for anybody, but I
        think it was harder because Peter is a giver. He knew what was at the
        other side of it for Rich, and he wanted to save him from it.” Peter was
        a victim of empathy, the powerful emotion that we experience when we
        imagine another person’s distress. Empathy is a pervasive force behind
        giving behaviors, but it’s also a major source of vulnerability. When
        Brad wasn’t doing well and accepted a new job, Peter felt his pain, and
        bought his clients without hesitation. When he considered how Rich would
        feel about being ousted, Peter felt sorry for him, and didn’t want to
        cut him out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter was falling into an empathy trap that’s visible in a classic
        negotiation study. Researchers brought people together in pairs to
        negotiate the purchase of electronics products such as TVs. Half of the
        negotiating pairs were strangers; the other half were dating couples. In
        each pair, one negotiator was the seller, and the other was the buyer.
        On average, who do you think would achieve more joint profits: the
        strangers or the dating couples? I assumed that the dating couples would
        do better, because they would trust each other more, share more
        information, and discover opportunities for mutual gains. But the dating
        couples did substantially worse than the strangers, achieving lower
        joint profits. Before the negotiation, the researchers asked the dating
        couples how in love they were. The stronger their feelings of love, the
        worse they did. The dating couples—especially the ones in love—operated
        like selfless givers. Their default approach was to empathize with their
        partners’ needs and give in right away, regardless of their own
        interests. Concern for their partners had the effect of
        “short-circuiting efforts to discover integrative solutions in favor of
        more accessible but less mutually satisfactory outcomes,” the
        researchers write, leading to a “‘kid gloves’ approach to problem
        solving.” When researchers studied selfless givers at the bargaining
        table, the same pattern surfaced. People who agreed with statements like
        “I always place the needs of others above my own” were anxious about
        putting strain on the relationship, so they accommodated their
        counterparts by giving away value.

        “For Lillian Bauer, these shifts in strategy catalyzed a chump change.
        As Bauer learned to leverage her natural strengths in advocating for
        others and reading other people’s motives, she adapted her behavior to
        invest in those on whom she could have the greatest influence and
        encouraged them to give as well. The cumulative effect was that she
        transformed from a doormat into a successful giver. Even though her
        generosity initially slowed her rise to partner, she ended up getting
        there ahead of schedule. Lillian Bauer was one of the first members of
        her consulting class to make partner.
