        Dave Walton took a deep breath. He was an employment law expert who specialized in trade secrets
and employee competition cases. As a partner at the firm Cozen O’Connor, Dave was one of the
youngest lawyers to be elected shareholder, and he had been named a Pennsylvania Super Lawyer—
Rising Star for several years. But he was about to stand up and give his first closing argument in front
of a jury.
It was 2008, and Dave was representing a company that owned Acme-Hardesty, a Pennsylvania
castor oil distributor that received its supplies from Jayant Oils and Derivatives in Mumbai, India. In
December 2006, the CEO of Acme’s parent company was informed that Jayant was setting up a U.S.
office and sales organization, and would no longer supply Acme with castor oil. During the following
month, Acme executives learned that Jayant was planning to sell castor oil products directly to
customers in the U.S. market, competing with Acme for business.
In the summer of 2006, two Acme employees had jumped ship to Jayant and helped them set up
the competing company. Acme’s parent company filed suit against Jayant and the two employees,
accusing them of stealing trade secrets and confidential information.
Dave prepared diligently and spoke passionately. He presented evidence that in March 2006,
while still working for Acme, the employees agreed to financial terms to help Jayant start the
competing distributor. In June, each of the two received initial payments of $50,000 from Jayant for
consulting services.
The employees gave notice that they were leaving and went straight to India without informing
Acme of their new positions. Dave argued that in India, they incorporated knowledge from Acme into

        The defendants were represented by three different prominent law firms, and Dave’s opponent in
the trial was highly articulate. He had twenty-five years of experience, a law degree from Columbia
and an undergraduate degree from Cornell, and a slew of awards under his belt, including being
named one of the top one hundred lawyers in Pennsylvania and the litigator of the week for the entire
country. One source described him as an “accomplished, knowledgeable, and sophisticated lawyer
who is amazing on his feet in court.”
The defense attorney was eloquent and polished, telling the jury that Jayant engaged in legitimate
competition, as it was entitled to do. Acme did lose some customers, the lawyer admitted, but it
wasn’t because the employees did anything wrong. Acme was the middle man distributing Jayant’s
castor oil products to customers. By cutting out the middleman, Jayant was able to sell the products
more cheaply, which is precisely the point of fair competition. The employees were being treated
poorly at Acme: one described it as a “hellhole,” the worst job of her life. The defense attorney
nailed his key arguments, and he questioned the credibility of Dave’s main witnesses. Dave was
impressed with the skill that the defense attorney demonstrated. “He was really good. He made better
arguments than we anticipated.”

      <h3>Presenting: The Value of Vulnerabilit</h3>
      <p>
        At age twenty-six, two years after finishing my doctorate in organizational psychology, I was asked to
teach senior military leaders how to motivate their troops. The military was trying to transition from a
command-and-control model to a more collaborative approach, and I happened to be doing research
related to the topic. My first assignment was a four-hour class for twenty-three colonels in the U.S.
Air Force. They were former fighter pilots, having logged an average of more than 3,500 flight hours
and 300 combat hours. Their aircraft of choice: F-16s carrying rockets and precision-guided
munitions. And just as Top Gun had taught me, they had badass nicknames.
Striker was in charge of more than 53,000 officers and a $300 million operating budget. Sand
Dune was an aerospace engineer who flew combat missions in operations Desert Storm, Iraqi
Freedom, and Enduring Freedom. Boomer was running programs that cost more than $15 billion,
including unmanned aircraft that could be flown from New Mexico to Afghanistan by remote control.
The colonels were in their forties and fifties—twice my age. They had spent their careers in an
organization that rewarded seniority, and I had none. Although I had some relevant knowledge and a
doctorate, I was way out of my league, and it showed. At the end of the day, the colonels completed
course feedback forms. Two comments were particularly revealing:
Stealth: “More quality information in audience than on podium.”
Gunner: “The instructor was very knowledgeable, but not yet experienced
enough . . . slightly missed the needs of the audience. The material was very
academic . . . I gained very little from the session. I trust the instructor did
gain useful insight.”

      </p>
      <p>
        Others were gentler, but the message still came through loud and clear. Bomber said, “The
professors get younger every year,” and Stingray added, “I prefer that my professors be older than I
am or I start to believe that I am approaching middle age and we all know that is not true . . . don’t
we?”
I had started my presentation to the colonels with powerful communication: I talked confidently
about my credentials. This wasn’t how I usually opened in the classroom. In my role as a professor,
I’ve always felt a strong sense of responsibility to give to my students, and I tend to be more
concerned about connecting with students than establishing my authority. When I teach
undergraduates, I open my very first class with a story about my biggest failures. With the Air Force
colonels, though, I was worried about credibility, and I only had four hours—instead of my usual four
months—to establish it. Deviating from my typical vulnerable style, I adopted a dominant tone in
describing my qualifications. But the more I tried to dominate, the more the colonels resisted. I failed
to win their respect, and I felt disappointed and embarrassed.
I had another session with Air Force colonels coming up on my schedule, so I decided to try a
different opening. Instead of talking confidently about my credentials, I opened with a more
powerless, self-deprecating remark:
“I know what some of you are thinking right now:
‘What can I possibly learn from a professor who’s twelve years old?’”
There was a split second of awkward silence, and I held my breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Powerless communication had made all the difference. Instead of working to establish my
credentials, I made myself vulnerable, and called out the elephant in the room. Later, I adopted the
same approach when teaching Army generals and Navy flag officers, and it worked just as well. I
was using my natural communication style, and it helped me connect with a skeptical audience.
Takers tend to worry that revealing weaknesses will compromise their dominance and authority.
Givers are much more comfortable expressing vulnerability: they’re interested in helping others, not
gaining power over them, so they’re not afraid of exposing chinks in their armor. By making
themselves vulnerable, givers can actually build prestige.
But there’s a twist: expressing vulnerability is only effective if the audience receives other signals
establishing the speaker’s competence. In a classic experiment led by the psychologist Elliot
Aronson, students listened to one of four tapes of a candidate auditioning for a Quiz Bowl team. Half
of the time, the candidate was an expert, getting 92 percent of questions right. The other half of the
time, the candidate had only average knowledge, getting 30 percent right.
As expected, audiences favored the expert. But an interesting wrinkle emerged when the tape
included a clumsy behavior by the candidate. Dishes crashed, and the candidate said, “Oh, my
goodness—I’ve spilled coffee all over my new suit.”
When the average candidate was clumsy, audiences liked him even less.
But when the expert was clumsy, audiences liked him even more.
Psychologists call this the pratfall ef ect. Spilling a cup of coffee hurt the image of the average
candidate: it was just another reason for the audience to dislike him. But the same blunder helped the
expert appear human and approachable—instead of superior and distant.* This explains why Dave
Walton’s stuttering made a positive impression on the jury. The fact that Dave was willing to make
himself vulnerable, putting his stutter out for the world to see, earned their respect and admiration.
The jurors liked and trusted him, and they listened carefully to him. This set the stage for Dave to
convince them with the substance of his arguments

      <h3>Selling: Separating the Swindlers from the Samaritans</h3>
      <p>
        Expressing vulnerability in ways that are unrelated to competence may build prestige, but it’s only a
starting point for givers to exercise influence. To effectively influence people, we need to convert the
respect that we earn into a reason for our audiences to change their attitudes and behaviors. Nowhere
is this clearer than in sales, where the entire job depends on getting people to buy—and buy more. We
often stereotype salespeople as manipulative and Machiavellian, thinking of great sellers as
intimidating, confrontational, self-serving, or even sometimes deceitful. Daniel Pink finds that the first
words that come to mind when we think of salespeople are pushy, ugh, and yuck. In one study, people
ranked the forty-four most commonly chosen MBA occupations in terms of how socially responsible
they were. Salesperson ranked forty-third, barely above stockbroker at the very bottom of the social
responsibility list. This sets up the expectation that top salespeople must be takers, yet in the opening
chapter, we saw a preview of evidence that many highly productive salespeople are givers. How do
givers sell effectively?
Bill Grumbles is a powerful executive, but if you met him, you probably wouldn’t realize it. He
speaks so softly that you might find yourself leaning forward just to hear him. After working his way
up to a vice presidency at HBO, he became the president of worldwide distribution for TBS.
Throughout his career, Grumbles has gone out of his way to help and mentor others. Today, he spends
his time coaching business students on leadership and volunteering to give them career advice. Early
on, powerless communication actually helped him rise to the top of HBO’s sales charts.

      </p>
      <p>
        Back in 1977, HBO was an unknown brand; most Americans didn’t even have cable. Grumbles
was in his late twenties, and he was sent to open an HBO sales office in Kansas City. He had no sales
experience, so he started doing what he did best as a giver: asking questions. His questions were
sincere, and customers responded. “I would be on a sales call, and I’d look at the walls, around the
office, and see their interests. I’d ask about their grandchildren, or their favorite sports team. I would
ask a question, and customers would talk for twenty minutes.” Other salespeople were bringing in one
contract a month. Grumbles was four times as productive: he brought in one contract a week.
By asking questions and listening to the answers, Grumbles showed his customers that he cared
about their interests. This built prestige: customers respected and admired the concern that he
showed. After one of his early sales calls, a customer took him aside to tell him he was a “great
conversationalist.” Grumbles laughs: “I’d hardly said a thing!”
Asking questions opened the door for customers to experience what the psychologist James
Pennebaker calls the joy of talking. Years ago, Pennebaker divided strangers into small groups.
Imagine that you’ve just joined one of his groups, and you have fifteen minutes to talk with strangers
about a topic of your choice. You might chat about your hometown, where you went to college, or
your career
      </p>
      <p>
        After the fifteen minutes are up, you rate how much you like the group. It turns out that the more
you talked, the more you like the group. This isn’t surprising, since people love to talk about
themselves. But let me ask you another question: How much did you learn about the group?
Logically, learning about the people around you should depend on listening. The less you talk, the
more you should discover about the group. But Pennebaker found the opposite: the more you talk, the
more you think you’ve learned about the group. By talking like a taker and dominating the
conversation, you believe you’ve actually come to know the people around you, even though they
barely spoke. In Opening Up, Pennebaker muses, “Most of us find that communicating our thoughts is
a supremely enjoyable learning experience.”
It’s the givers, by virtue of their interest in getting to know us, who ask us the questions that enable
us to experience the joy of learning from ourselves. And by giving us the floor, givers are actually
learning about us and from us, which helps them figure out how to sell us things we already value.
To shed further light on how givers sell successfully, I want to take you on a journey to Raleigh,
North Carolina, where I’m posing as a mystery shopper. I’m working with an innovative optometry
company called Eye Care Associates, with the goal of figuring out what distinguishes star sellers
from the rest of the pack. Every employee in the company has filled out a survey about whether
they’re givers, takers, or matchers, and now it’s time for me to see them in action.
