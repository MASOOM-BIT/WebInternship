      <p>
        A number of years ago, an imposing figure made his mark on the sports
        world. Well over six feet tall and two hundred pounds, Derek Sorenson
        was a tough, aggressive competitor who struck fear into the hearts of
        his opponents. He led his NCAA team to a national championship and went
        on to play in the pros. After his career was cut short by an injury, he
        was courted by the finest professional teams in his sport to become a
        contract negotiator. He would be wheeling and dealing with players and
        agents in the hopes of building a world-class team. To sharpen his
        bargaining skills, Derek enrolled in a negotiation course at a leading
        business school. During each class session, he had the chance to
        practice negotiating in a variety of roles, ranging from a
        pharmaceutical executive trying to buy a manufacturing plant to a condo
        developer in a heated dispute with a carpenter. In one of his earliest
        negotiations, Derek bought a property as a real estate investment, and
        in top taker form, he persuaded the listing agent to sell at a price
        that went directly against her client’s interests. On an icy winter
        evening, Derek played the role of one of four fishermen who ran
        competing businesses. They were overfishing to the point that the
        resource would become extinct, and they sat down to discuss how they
        should handle the dilemma. One negotiator suggested that they should
        split the maximum total fishing in four equal parts. Another proposed a
        different way of matching based on equity rather than equality: since
        some of them were running larger operations than others, they should
        each reduce their fishing by 50 percent. They all agreed that this was a
        fair solution, and the meeting was adjourned. Now, it was up to each
        negotiator to make an individual decision about whether to honor the
        agreement and how much to fish?
      </p>
      <p>
        Two of the negotiators stuck to their commitments, reducing their
        fishing by 50 percent. The third operated like a giver: she reduced her
        fishing by 65 percent. The group was all set to keep the resource
        intact, but Derek chose not to reduce his fishing at all. He took as
        much as he could, actually increasing his fishing total and decimating
        the other three entrepreneurs. Before the group met, Derek had the
        lowest profits of the four. After he took far more than his share of the
        harvest, his profits were 70 percent higher than the giver’s and 31
        percent higher than those of the other two. When confronted by his
        colleagues, Derek responded, “I wanted to win the negotiations and
        destroy my competitors.” Just a few months later, Derek began a meteoric
        rise in his career. He was hired by a professional sports team and
        established a reputation as a dominant negotiator, playing a key role in
        assembling a team that went on to win a world championship. Derek was
        promoted in an unusually short period of time and recognized as one of
        the one hundred most powerful people in his sport—while still in his
        thirties. When Derek first started working for his team as a
        professional negotiator, his job was to manage the budget, identify top
        prospects, and negotiate contracts with agents to sign new players and
        keep existing players. Since resources were tight, bargaining like a
        taker would work to his advantage. Derek began to search for underrated
        talent, and stumbled upon a gem of a player in the minor leagues. He sat
        down with the player’s agent to negotiate a contract. True to form,
        Derek made a lowball offer. The agent was frustrated: several comparable
        players were earning higher salaries. The agent accused Derek of pushing
        him around and demanded more money, but Derek ignored the demands and
        didn’t budge. Eventually, the agent gave in and agreed to Derek’s terms.
        It was a win for Derek, saving his team thousands of dollars.

      <h3>ACTIONS FOR IMPACT</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re interested in applying the principles in this book to your
        work or your life, I’ve compiled a set of practical actions that you can
        take. Many of these actions are based on the strategies and habits of
        successful givers, and in each case, I’ve provided resources and tools
        for evaluating, organizing, or expanding giving. Some of the steps focus
        on incorporating more giving into your daily behaviors; others emphasize
        ways that you can fine-tune your giving, locate fellow givers, or engage
        others in giving. 1. Test Your Giver Quotient. We often live in a
        feedback vacuum, deprived of knowledge about how our actions affect
        others. So that you can track your impact and assess your
        self-awareness, I’ve designed a series of free online tools. Visit
        www.giveandtake.com to take a free survey that tests your giver
        quotient. Along with filling out your own survey, you can invite people
        in your network to rate your reciprocity style, and you’ll receive data
        on how often you’re seen as a giver, taker, and matcher. 2. Run a
        Reciprocity Ring. What could be achieved in your organization—and what
        giving norms would develop—if groups of people got together weekly for
        twenty minutes to make requests and help one another fulfill them? For
        more information on how to start a Reciprocity Ring in your
        organization, visit Cheryl and Wayne Baker’s company, Humax
        (www.humaxnetworks.com), which offers a suite of social networking tools
        for individuals and organizations. They’ve created materials to run a
        Reciprocity Ring in person and a Ripplleffect tool for running it
        online. People typically come together in groups of fifteen to thirty.
        Each person presents a request to the group members, who make
        contributions: they use their knowledge, resources, and connections to
        help fulfill the request. Another start-up, Favo.rs (http://favo.rs),
        has created an online marketplace where people can make and fulfill
        requests for help. 3. Help Other People Craft Their Jobs—or Craft Yours
        to Incorporate More Giving. People often end up working on tasks that
        aren’t perfectly aligned with their interests and skills. A powerful way
        to give is to help others work on tasks that are more interesting,
        meaningful, or developmental. In 2011, a vice president named Jay at a
        large multinational retailer sent e-mails to each of his employees
        announcing a top-secret mission, with details to be shared on a
        need-to-know basis in oneon-one meetings. When employees arrived
        individually for the meetings, Jay unveiled the confidential project. He
        asked them what they would enjoy doing that might also be of interest to
        other people. He inquired about their hobbies and personal interests,
        and what they would love to spend more time doing at the company. He
        then sent them out into the company to pursue their mission with three
        rules: it has to (1) appeal to at least one other person, (2) be low or
        no cost, and (3) be initiated by you. Throughout the year, Jay checked
        in to see how the secret missions were going. About two thirds
      </p>
      <p>
        of his employees had made some effort toward making their visions a
        reality, and roughly half of those employees succeeded in launching
        them. One of Jay’s favorite missions resulted in a book club where
        employees read books and discussed topics that were of personal interest
        and relevance to their jobs. “People had permission to do all of that
        stuff before I ever asked that question,” Jay reflects. “But somehow,
        asking that question in my role gives people permission to pursue their
        interests in a way they didn’t have before. It’s planting seeds, with
        some percentage of them turning into real initiatives.” These seeds have
        bloomed for many of his employees, and for Jay as well: in 2012, he was
        selected to become the vice president of HR for a major division of his
        company, where he’s responsible for more than 45,000 employees.

      <h3>Glimpsing Glimmers in Chunks of Coal</h3>
      <p>
        In the secret missions, Jay encouraged his employees to engage in job
        crafting, a concept introduced by Amy Wrzesniewski and Jane Dutton,
        management professors at Yale and the University of Michigan,
        respectively. Job crafting involves innovating around a job description,
        creatively adding and customizing tasks and responsibilities to match
        personal interests and values. A natural concern is that people might
        craft their jobs in ways that fail to contribute to their organizations.
        To address this question, Amy, Justin Berg, and I partnered with
        Jennifer Kurkoski and Brian Welle, who run a people and innovation lab
        at Google. In a study across the United States and Europe, we randomly
        assigned Google employees working in sales, finance, operations,
        accounting, marketing, and human resources to a job-crafting workshop.
        The employees created a map of how they’d like to modify their tasks,
        crafting a more ideal but still realistic vision of their jobs that
        aligned with their interests and values. Six weeks later, their managers
        and coworkers rated them as significantly happier and more effective.
        Many Google employees found ways to spend more time on tasks that they
        found interesting or meaningful; some delegated unpleasant tasks; and
        others were able to customize their jobs to incorporate new knowledge
        and skills that they wanted to develop. All told, Google employees found
        their work more enjoyable and were motivated to perform better, and in
        some cases, these gains lasted for six months. Job crafting worked
        across reciprocity styles: givers, takers, and matchers all became more
        effective. The givers saw job crafting as an opportunity to expand their
        impact, so they generated ways to add more value to other people and the
        company, such as mentoring junior colleagues, creating better products
        for clients, and improving training for new hires. The matchers were
        grateful for the opportunity to pursue more meaningful and interesting
        work, and reciprocated by working harder. Even the takers recognized
        that to advance their own careers, they needed to craft their jobs in
        ways that would benefit the company as well as themselves.

        5. Embrace the Five-Minute Favor. If you visit a 106 Miles Meetup
        (www.meetup.com/106miles), you might see Panda Adam Rifkin in top form.
        He’s a master of the five-minute favor, and you can follow Panda’s lead
        by asking people what they need and looking for ways to help at a
        minimal personal cost. Rifkin’s two favorite offers are to give honest
        feedback and make an introduction. For example, here’s a simple exercise
        to get started as a connector. Start by going through your Rolodex,
        LinkedIn, or Facebook network. Identify pairs of people who share an
        uncommon commonality. Then, pick one pair a week and introduce them by
        e-mail. Rifkin also recommends reconnecting with dormant ties—not to get
        something, but to give. Once a month, reach out to one person with whom
        you haven’t spoken in years. Find out what they’re working on and ask if
        there are ways that you can be helpful. On a related note, you can learn
        more about David Hornik’s approach to giving by visiting Venture Blog
        (www.ventureblog.com/). 6. Practice Powerless Communication, but Become
        an Advocate. Developing greater comfort and skill with powerless
        communication requires a change in habits—from talking to listening,
        selfpromoting to advice-seeking, and advocating to inquiring. Jim
        Quigley, a senior partner at Deloitte who previously served as CEO,
        decided to work on his powerless communication. He set a goal in
        meetings to talk no more than 20 percent of the time. “One of my
        objectives is listening. Many times, you can have bigger impact if you
        know what to ask, rather than knowing what to say. I don’t learn
        anything when I’m speaking. I learn a lot when I’m listening,” Quigley
        told me. As he shifted from answers toward questions, Quigley found
        himself gaining a deeper understanding of other people’s needs. “It
        doesn’t come naturally to everyone, but it’s a habit, and you can form
        that habit.” For more on the power of powerless communication, visit the
        blogs by Susan Cain (www.thepowerofintroverts.com) and Jennifer
        Kahnweiler (www.theintrovertedleaderblog.com). At the same time, it’s
        important to make sure that powerless communication doesn’t come at the
        expense of assertiveness when advocating for others’ interests and our
        own. GetRaised is a free resource that offers advice on negotiating
        salary increases. According to cofounder Matt Wallaert, the average pay
        increase is $6,726, provided that you’re underpaid. About half of male
        users succeed in getting a raise—compared with three quarters of female
        users (https://getraised.com).
      </p>
      <p>
        Seek Help More Often. If you want other people to be givers, one of the
        easiest steps is to ask. When you ask for help, you’re not always
        imposing a burden. Some people are givers, and by asking for help,
        you’re creating an opportunity for them to express their values and feel
        valued. By asking for a five-minute favor, you impose a relatively small
        burden—and if you ask a matcher, you can count on having an opportunity
        to reciprocate. Wayne and Cheryl Baker note that people can “Start the
        spark of reciprocity by making requests as well as helping others. Help
        generously and without thought of return; but also ask often for what
        you need.”
