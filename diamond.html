        When Barack Obama entered the White House, a reporter asked him if he
        had a favorite app. Without hesitating, Obama named the iReggie, which
        “has my books, my newspapers, my music all in one place.” The iReggie
        wasn’t a piece of software, though. It was a man named Reggie Love, and
        no one would have guessed that he would become an indispensable resource
        to President Obama. Love was a star athlete at Duke, where he
        accomplished the rare feat of playing key roles on both the football and
        basketball teams. But after two years of failed NFLtryouts following
        graduation, he decided to shift gears. Having studied political science
        and public policy at Duke, Love pursued an internship on Capitol Hill.
        With a background as a jock and little work experience, he ended up with
        a position in the mailroom of Obama’s Senate office. Yet within a year,
        at the young age of twenty-six, Love was promoted up from the mailroom
        to become Obama’s body man, or personal assistant. Love worked
        eighteen-hour days and flew more than 880,000 miles with Obama. “His
        ability to juggle so many responsibilities with so little sleep has been
        an inspiration to watch,” Obama said. “He is the master of what he
        does.” When Obama was elected president, an aide remarked that Love
        “took care of the president.” Love went out of his way to respond to
        every letter that came into his office. “I always wanted to acknowledge
        people, and let them know their voice was heard,” Love told me.
        According to a reporter, Love is “known for his exceptional and
        universal kindness.” Decades earlier, in Love’s home state of North
        Carolina, a woman named Beth Traynham decided to go back to school to
        study accounting. Beth was in her early thirties, and numbers were not
        her strong suit. She didn’t learn to tell time on an analog clock until
        she was in third grade, and in high school, she leaned heavily on a
        boyfriend to get her through her math classes. Even in adulthood, she
        struggled with percentages.
      </p>
      <p>
        IWhen it came time to take the certified public accountant (CPA) exam,
        Beth was convinced that she would fail. Beyond the fact that she had
        trouble with math, she was facing serious time constraints. She was
        juggling a full-time job with taking care of three children at home—two
        of whomwere toddlers, both of whom came down with chicken pox within two
        weeks of the exam. The lowest point came when she spent an entire
        weekend trying to understand pension accounting, and after three days,
        felt like she understood less than when she started. When Beth sat down
        to take the CPA exam, right off the bat, she had a panic attack when she
        looked at the multiple-choice questions. “I would rather go through
        natural childbirth (again) than ever have to sit for that exam again,”
        Beth said. She left dejected, certain that she had failed. On a Monday
        morning in August 1992, Beth’s phone rang. The voice on the other end of
        the line said that she had earned the gold medal on the CPA exam in
        North Carolina. She thought it was a friend playing a joke on her, so
        she called the state board later that day to verify the news. It wasn’t
        a joke: Beth had the single highest score in the entire state. Later,
        she was dumbfounded when she received another award: the national Elijah
        Watt Sells Award for Distinctive Performance, granted to the top ten CPA
        exam scores in the whole country, beating out 136,525 other candidates.
        Today, Beth is a widely respected partner at the accounting firm Hughes,
        Pittman & Gupton, LLC. She has been named an Impact 25 financial leader
        and one of the top twenty-five women in business in the Research
        Triangle.

      <h3>Facing the Mirror: Looking Good or Doing Good?</h3>
      <p>
        Barry Staw is a world-renowned organizational behavior professor at the
        University of California at Berkeley, and he has spent his career trying
        to understand why people make bad decisions in organizations. In an
        ingenious study, Staw and Ha Hoang collected data on all 240-plus
        players who were picked in the first two rounds of the NBA draft between
        1980 and 1986, in hopes of seeing what effect draft position had on a
        player’s career. They measured each player’s performance with a series
        of different metrics: scoring (points per minute, field goal percentage,
        and free throw percentage), toughness (rebounds and blocks per minute),
        and quickness (assists and steals per minute). Staw and Hoang controlled
        for each player’s performance on all of these metrics, as well as for
        the player’s injuries and illnesses, whether the player was a guard,
        forward, or center, and the quality of the player’s team based on
        win/loss records. Then they examined how much time on the court the
        players received and how long their teams kept them before trading them,
        to see if teams made the mistake of overinvesting in players just
        because they drafted them early. The results produced a devastating
        conclusion: teams couldn’t let go of their big bets. They stuck with the
        players whom they drafted early, giving them more playing time and
        refusing to trade them even if they played poorly. After taking
        performance out of the equation, players who were drafted earlier still
        spent more minutes on the court and were less likely to be traded. For
        every slot higher in the draft, players were given an average of
        twenty-two more minutes in their second season, and their teams were
        still investing more in them by their fifth season, when each draft slot
        higher accounted for eleven more minutes on the court. And for every
        slot higher in the draft, players were 3 percent less likely to be
        traded
      </p>
      <p>
        BThis study is a classic case of what Staw calls escalation of
        commitment to a losing course of action. Over the past four decades,
        extensive research led by Staw shows that once people make an initial
        investment of time, energy, or resources, when it goes sour, they’re at
        risk for increasing their investment. Gamblers in the hole believe that
        if they just play one more hand of poker, they’ll be able to recover
        their losses or even win big. Struggling entrepreneurs think that if
        they just give their startups a little more sweat, they can turn it
        around. When an investment doesn’t pay off, even if the expected value
        is negative, we invest more. Economists explain this behavior using a
        concept known as the “sunk cost fallacy”: when estimating the value of a
        future investment, we have trouble ignoring what we’ve already invested
        in the past. Sunk costs are part of the story, but new research shows
        that other factors matter more. To figure out why and when escalation of
        commitment happens, researchers at Michigan State University analyzed
        166 different studies. Sunk costs do have a small effect—decision makers
        are biased in favor of their previous investments—but three other
        factors are more powerful. One is anticipated regret: will I be sorry
        that I didn’t give this another chance? The second is project
        completion: if I keep investing, I can finish the project. But the
        single most powerful factor is ego threat: if I don’t keep investing,
        I’ll look and feel like a fool. In response to ego threat, people invest
        more, hoping to turn the p

      <h3>Glimpsing Glimmers in Chunks of Coal</h3>
      <p>
        As a giver, Inman built this championship team with an approach that
        mirrored C. J. Skender’s: seeing potential in players where others
        didn’t. “Inman wanted a complete portfolio on everybody he was
        interested in,” writes Wayne Thompson. “No doubt that is what made him
        so successful in finding diamonds in the rough.” Half of the top six
        scorers on the championship team—and five of the top nine—were drafted
        late by Inman, in the second or third round. “He was way ahead of the
        curve in seeing potential,” noted Steve Duin. “Stu, in the subculture of
        basketball gurus, was near the apex. He was considered a genius,” said
        Mavericks president Norm Sonju. In a chronicle of the 1984 draft, Filip
        Bondy writes that Inman was viewed by many as “the best personnel man in
        the league. He was so good, so respected, that other clubs would track
        his scouting missions and listen very carefully to rumors about which
        players might interest him.” In the 1970s, most basketball teams were
        focusing heavily on observable physical talents such as speed, strength,
        coordination, agility, and vertical leap. Inman thought it was also
        important to pay attention to the inner attributes of players, so he
        decided to begin evaluating their psychological makeup. Before a draft,
        along with reviewing a player’s statistics and watching him play, Inman
        wanted to understand him as a person. He would watch players closely
        during the pregame warm-up to see how hard they worked, and he would
        interview their coaches, family members, friends, and teachers about
        issues of motivation, mind-set, and integrity. According to the
        Oregonian, “Inman made his reputation by finding undervalued players. .
        . . His eye for talent was as sharp as his feel for people. He wanted
        players whose character and intelligence were as high as their vertical
        jumps.” In 1970, Inman joined the Blazers, then a brand-new NBA team, as
        chief talent scout. That summer, he held an open tryout for people to
        put their basketball skills to the test. It was partially a public
        relations stunt to generate local excitement about basketball, but Inman
        was also looking for players who had gone overlooked by other teams.
        None of the guys from the open tryout made the team, but Inman’s
        fascination with unlikely candidates would bear fruit several years
        later. In 1975, with the twenty-fifth pick in the second round of the
        draft, Inman selected a little-known Jewish forward named Bob Gross.
        Coaches and fans thought it was a mistake. Gross had played college
        basketball at Seattle, averaging ten points a game, and then transferred
        to Long Beach State, where he averaged just six and a half points in his
        junior year. “The story of Bob Gross’s collegiate and professional
        basketball life was that nobody noticed him,” wrote Frank Coffey in a
        book about the Blazers, “until they really started looking hard.”
      </p>
      <p>
        By that point, Brown had played ten seasons for four different teams,
        averaging under seven points and six rebounds in more than five hundred
        games. In his previous season, he was spending just thirteen minutes on
        the court. When Brown joined Jordan’s Bobcats, his playing time was
        doubled to twenty-six minutes a game. The Bobcats gave Brown more
        minutes than he had played in the prior two seasons combined, yet he
        continued to struggle, averaging under eight points and seven rebounds.
        Jordan “wanted to give Kwame another opportunity,” Brown’s agent said.
        “There’s been so much written about the fact that this was Michael’s
        first pick and so much criticism directed at both of them when it didn’t
        work out.” A giver might admit the mistake and move on, but Jordan was
        still trying to turn the bad investment around. “I love Michael, but he
        just has not done a good job,” says friend and former Olympic teammate
        Charles Barkley. “I don’t think Michael has hired enough people around
        him who will disagree.” Under Jordan’s direction, in 2012, the Bobcats
        finished with the worst winning percentage in NBA history. Conversely,
        Inman’s teams achieved surprising levels of success. In addition to
        building the 1977 team that went from last place to the title in just a
        year with a large number of unknowns, Inman’s draft picks made the
        Blazers a formidable team for years to come. After he left the Blazers
        in 1986, the team flourished under the leadership of Drexler, Porter,
        and Kersey. The three hidden gems, discovered by Inman in three
        consecutive years, led the Blazers to the Finals twice. Once again,
        Inman rarely received the credit. To the casual fan, it may appear that
        Inman was a failure, but basketball insiders regard him as one of the
        finest talent evaluators the sport has ever seen. Inman’s experience,
        coupled with research evidence, reveals that givers don’t excel only at
        recognizing and developing talent; they’re also surprisingly good at
        moving on when their bets don’t work out. Stu Inman spent the last four
        years of his life volunteering as an assistant coach for the Lake Oswego
        High School basketball team in Oregon. “He had them to a T,” said Lake
        Oswego’s head coach. “Not only did he have them as basketball players,
        he had their characters, too. He took time not to prejudge people but to
        see them as they really are.” At Lake Oswego, Stu Inman helped to groom
        a young player named Kevin Love, who has gone on to pursue the legacy
        that Sam Bowie and LaRue Martin never fulfilled: thrive as a big man who
        can shoot. As a 6'10'' center, Love has made the U.S. Olympic team and
        two All-Star teams in his first four seasons, been named the NBA’s most
        improved player, and won the three-point shooting championship.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If you choose to champion great talent, you will be picking one of the
        most altruistic things a person can do,” writes George Anders. “In any
        given year, quick-hit operators may make more money and win more
        recognition, at least briefly. Over time, though, that dynamic
        reverses.”
